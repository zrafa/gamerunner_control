GameRunner Game Control for Openmoko Mobile Devices (FreeRunner phone)

Rafael Ignacio Zurita <rafaelignacio.zurita@gmail.com>


Application which reads touchscreen and accelerometers, and then,
sends key Xevents. If there is some game running it gets the XEvents and
manages those like if these come from keyboard directly.


Current version. For powermanga run :
#!/bin/sh
# sleep 10
# 300 va para abajo
# 150 va para arriba facil
exec ./gr_control_for_dmenu 190 54 40 45 4 90 0 0 0 0 Escape space Up space Down Left Right Left Right Up Down Escape space Escape space Escape space space 1 2




IT IS JUST A TEST!.. It works barely for our games, but we need
to put order the source code.

With this tool, we can build games without modify the code to control it on
gamerunner.

GameRunner game control has two modes. You can switch between modes using the
AUX buttom. The idea is to have one mode to navigate menus, and another when
you are playing the game. If we use accelerometer for up/down/left/right, it is
too hard to use the game menu. So you can use one mode without accelerometers
and another with acceleromenters and proper touchscreen for keys.

Check an example to understand how to use it with your ported games. Current
games using this tool are : tecnoballz, quake1, powermanga, tyrian21.
Example of Usage :

./gr_game_control 0 0 40 40 4 90 null null null null Escape Return Up Return Down Left Right Left Right Up Down Escape Escape 0 0 space space space 1 6

0 : accelerometer_zHome /* Stores new "Home" position */
0 : accelerometer_yHome /* Stores new "Home" position */
40 : accelerometer_zwindow /* DeadZone in Pixels */
40 : accelerometer_ywindow /* DeadZone in Pixels */
4 : accelerometer_zscale /* Scaling factor for motion (acceleration) */
90 : accelerometer_yscale /* Scaling factor for motion (acceleration) */

null null null null Escape Return Up Return Down Left Right : the four "null"s
are for accelerometers. In this case we don't want to use accelerometers, so
only touchscreen is used. This first mode is useful for game menu. The next
"Escape Return Up Return Down Left Right" are the key Xevent to send when
pressing touchscreen.

Imagine the touchscreen with nine buttons. Only 7 are set.
Landscape Freerunner, 640x480 (or 320x240) :

1  2  3
4  5  6
7  8  9

The 2 button is not used. The 5 button is always used internally to set the
"Home" position of accelerometers. When you are playing and you want to set
a new "Home" position (the freerunner angle when you feel comfortable for 0
movements) just put the freerunner in your prefered position and press the 5
button (the center of the screen).

So what does "Escape Return Up Return Down Left Right" mean?
Okey, it means that when you press the 1 button (the uppermost left corner)
on screen, the gamerunner game control sends the Escape key event to X.
When you press the 3 button (the uppermost left corner) on screen, the
gamerunner game control sends the Enter key event to X.
The same with other:
4 : Up
6 : Return
7 : Down
8 : Left
9 : Right
There is a special word to use with acceleromenters : mouse.
If you use it the gamerunner game control sends relative mouse movements to X.
It is useful for games which can be played with mouse on pc, like quake, where
you can use the mouse to walk.
